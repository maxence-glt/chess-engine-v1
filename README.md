# chess-engine-v1

## About The Project
My first go at programing a chess engine.

Trying to stay simple while still getting all the core parts of an engine down
(evaluation, search, board representation, testing, etc).



### Built With
C++

C

GTest

Cmake

SDL

### Commenting
I tend to comment how functions work in .cpp files, and how they are used in .h files.
